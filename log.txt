id - 19  --- After nice result from 0.295 by setting source component = mp.Ey, changing it to 0.303

Added poly_tapering, changed f = 1/1536 --> 1/1.54

changed a_taperred --> a_poly_tapered

id - 21

Ran OG polynomial tapering witg a_cen = 0.349, a_end = 0.4, hx = hy = 0.25

id - 23  POLY

Changed wavg h to 0.22 and wvg w to 0.7,  hx = 0.25, hy = 0.4, w = 0.7, a_cen = 0.354, a_mirror = 0.4

id 27  POLY

same as id 23, just changed n_segments = 20

id 28

hx = 0.3, hy = 0.5, a = 0.449, w = 0.7, gamma = 0.1697

id 31  POLY

Same as ID 28, resolution : 30 ---> 40

id 32

Same as id 31, n_taper ---> 5, n_segment -----> 10

id 34

same as id 28, n_aper = Lx ----> 20

Sept 3
------

Re ran the two sweeps for wz = 190 and 200 ( ag and quint sim respectively )
will update log from one computer at a time. Current = quint sim 

Sept 8
------

Ran the sweeps for wz = 200 on ag, updated log on ag

Sept 14
-------- 
@quintsim
Updated data with wz 230 nm, pulled code to quint sim 

@quitnsim
Ran substrate simulation  wz = 220 nm@ag, pushed sweep_util

@quintsim
Ran substrate simulation wz = 190 nm@quinstim

Sept 23
-------
@quintsim 
Pushed results from @ag for wz = 220 nm substrate simulation and substrate simulation wz = 190

Sept 24
--------
@ag
Started wz = 190 nm no_sub sim @ag, pushed new substrate_sweep.py and log 

@quintsim2
Started wz = 220 nm no_sub sim @quintsim, pushed new substrate_sweep.py and log
